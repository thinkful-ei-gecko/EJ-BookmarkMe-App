# EJ-BookmarkMe-App

This is my Bookmark App where you can store your favorite or worst books based on your rating.
Only the Title and Url of the book is required while rating and description are optional!
You can sort the books by their rating by clicking on the default button or you can view more details about the book
when you click on the view button.
